## Security Scanning Infrastructure

This app is automatically generated with comprehensive security scanning infrastructure powered by Google's OSV-Scanner and npm audit.

### 🛡️ Automated Security Checks

**GitHub Actions** (Runs automatically on push/PR):
- ✅ OSV-Scanner for dependency vulnerabilities
- ✅ NPM Audit for known security issues
- ✅ Weekly scheduled scans (Mondays 9 AM UTC)
- ✅ SARIF upload for GitHub Security tab

**Local Development** (Run manually):
```bash
# Quick security scan (package-lock.json only)
npm run security:scan

# Comprehensive scan (all dependencies recursively)
npm run security:scan:all

# NPM audit (known vulnerabilities)
npm run security:audit

# Auto-fix npm audit issues
npm run security:fix

# Complete security check (OSV + NPM Audit)
npm run security:check
```

## 🔧 OSV-Scanner Installation

OSV-Scanner is a Go binary. Install it once globally:

### macOS/Linux:
```bash
# Via Go (recommended)
go install github.com/google/osv-scanner/cmd/osv-scanner@v1

# Via Homebrew (macOS)
brew install osv-scanner
```

### Verify Installation:
```bash
osv-scanner --version
```

## 🚨 Responding to Vulnerabilities

### Priority Levels:

**CRITICAL/HIGH** ⚠️ (Fix Immediately):
1. Run `npm run security:fix` to auto-fix if possible
2. If auto-fix unavailable, update vulnerable package manually
3. Test app thoroughly after fixes
4. Commit and push changes

**MODERATE** ⏰ (Fix within 7 days):
1. Review vulnerability details
2. Plan update strategy
3. Test in development environment
4. Deploy fix in next release

**LOW** 📝 (Fix when convenient):
1. Document in backlog
2. Fix during regular maintenance
3. Bundle with feature releases

### Manual Fixes:
```bash
# Update specific package
npm update package-name

# Update to specific version
npm install package-name@latest

# If dependency is deep in tree
npm update --depth=10
```

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Dependency Management:
- ✅ Run `npm run security:check` before every release
- ✅ Review security scan results in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Keep dependencies up to date (monthly review)
- ✅ Use exact versions for critical packages
- ❌ Never ignore security warnings without investigation

### Development Workflow:
1. **Before Commit**: Security scans pass locally
2. **During PR**: GitHub Actions scan passes
3. **Before Release**: Zero critical/high vulnerabilities
4. **After Release**: Monitor for new CVEs

### GitHub Security Tab:
- View all detected vulnerabilities
- Track remediation progress
- Enable Dependabot alerts
- Configure automated security updates

---

## 📈 Continuous Monitoring

### Scheduled Scans:
- **Weekly**: Every Monday at 9 AM UTC
- **On Demand**: Manual workflow trigger in GitHub Actions
- **Per Commit**: Automatic scan on push to main/develop

### Notifications:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Dependabot alerts
- Email notifications (if configured)
